# SHATTER!
The SHATTER! PC is a relatively portable, large briefcase sized gaming PC featuring modern features and a custom case made of aluminum.    

SHATTER! is enclosed within a 1.5ft x 3ft x 2ft enclosure made of brushed aluminum.   


SHATTER! contains a portable display and a keyboard and mouse mounted to a locking lid.   


SHATTER! contains custom IO panels such as two USB hubs connected to the USB ports on the motherboard's IO shield to provide extensive connections.       


SHATTER! also contains the unused USB C port as a display input on a custom IO panel mounted to a plexiglass divider.   


SHATTER! will have a Lexan or polycarbonate divider separating the display and custom IO panels from the internal hardware, but the hardware shall remain visible.   


SHATTER! requires a Mini ITX or B550I motherboard, a Mini ITX PSU with a minimum of 750W, and one intake and exhaust fan as well as a top-mounted liquid cooler.    


SHATTER! will have cut-outs on the aluminum covered by dust-proof mesh to provide proper fan functionality and airflow. The intake will be mounted on the right side of the enclosure, and exhaust will be mounted on the left. The liquid cooler shall be mounted on the top of the case, where the lid is facing downwards.   


SHATTER! must have an AC connection at all times during usage, but a battery backup may be used in a larger enclosure.   


SHATTER! must have a Lexan and acrylic dual-layered window on the left side to provide external visibility, as well as provide proper fluency for a custom PCIe bracket for the GPU.   


SHATTER! recommends a minimum GPU of an RTX 4060, the smallest size being a Zotac SOLO, recommended for smaller SHATTER! builds.   


SHATTER! recommends a minimum CPU of a Ryzen 5 5600x or similar.   


SHATTER! recommends a minimum of 4 fans including the liquid cooler, those with RGB functionality being connected to the motherboard via a 12v and 5v ARGB splitter.   


SHATTER! must have A GPU riser and the GPU shall be mounted vertically. The riser must have a bracket that can be easily mounted and is easy to model a PCIe expansion slot bracket for.    


SHATTER!, if you are unable to make a custom PCIe bracket, shall have a custom IO panel using extension cables for the unused HDMI and DisplayPort females, where one HDMI port is being used for a portable monitor. In this case, you may use a more-unstable vertical GPU brace, or you may make a custom brace that supports the entirety of the GPU and is mounted to the bottom of the case.   


SHATTER! should have a minimum 64GB of RAM in order to run most games flawlessly.
